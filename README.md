# genomevariations

Analyze genomic variations (SNPs, indels, etc.) associated with Alzheimer's Disease 

Use public datasets from resources like ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) --> genomic variant data (SNPs) and clinical data




Use data from platforms like the 1000 genomes project or ENCODE to identify genetic variations linked to specific traits or diseases

Use tools like Alphafold or PyMOL to predict and visualize protein structures

Compare predicted structures with known PDB files for accuracy

Analyze genomic or proteomic datasets to identify potential drug targets for a specific disease
